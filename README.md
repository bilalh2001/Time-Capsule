<h1>Time Capsule - Digital Message Scheduler</h1>

### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/your-video-link)

<h2>Description</h2>
The Time Capsule is a unique social media concept developed by me, designed to allow users to create and schedule digital messages for future delivery. Built using HTML and CSS, this platform features a sleek user interface, interactive recipient selection, and secure message storage. The project aims to help users capture memories, thoughts, and messages for future moments.

<h3></h3>

As a work in progress, I'm continuously enhancing the platform's functionality and design, with plans to implement advanced features like encryption for privacy and customizable delivery options. My goal is to create a meaningful digital experience that allows people to connect with their future selves or loved ones.
